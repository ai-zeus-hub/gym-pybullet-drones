Hyper parameter tuning.

The baseline of gpd has used the default of PPO. I tried a number of different attempts at solving this:

* changing learning rate
* changing vf_coef
* changing arch
* Using recurrent PPO

Ultimately I got training HoverAviary to 155_000 steps, but was unable to learn to move across the x,y axis (e.g. [0, 1, 1]).
Using the omni drone project as a guide for parameter tuning, I was able to vastly improve this, all the way down to 50_000 steps.


Another issue was the default reward function used dist ** 4. This resulted in poor training when the distance was less than 1.0.
To solved, I switched to the exponentiation function.

Observation space not including relative position.

The drone struggles to train when the target is at high velocity.

Normalization was an issue, and tuning the min-max clipping, particular for angular velocity.

Removing the relative position is proving to be very difficult.

Mixed up yaw being across the y-axis when it is actually across the x-axis. This made me mix up cos/sin, creating conflicting
positions for CNN.
