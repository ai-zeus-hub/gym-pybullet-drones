Hyper parameter tuning.

The baseline of gpd has used the default of PPO. I tried a number of different attempts at solving this:

* changing learning rate
* changing vf_coef
* changing arch
* Using recurrent PPO

Ultimately I got training HoverAviary to 155_000 steps, but was unable to learn to move across the x,y axis (e.g. [0, 1, 1]).
Using the omni drone project as a guide for parameter tuning, I was able to vastly improve this, all the way down to 50_000 steps.
